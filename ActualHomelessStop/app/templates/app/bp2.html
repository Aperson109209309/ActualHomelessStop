        On September 6th, Homeless Stop once again partnered with Keys for Change in Thirst-Aid, a summer-long campaign to ensure that no one goes thirsty. By coordinating volunteers across the Phoenix Metropolitan Area, we contributed over 1,400 bottles of clean, bottled water to Thirst-Aid, a small but significant step in the campaign against heat-related deaths.

        Every year, over 600 people lose their lives to heat stroke and other heat-related conditions such as dehydration and hyperthermia in Maricopa county, with a significant amount of these individuals being homeless. The homeless are especially vulnerable to the summer heat, lacking basic shelter and ready access to water and air conditioning. Any donation, no matter how small, can save lives.
